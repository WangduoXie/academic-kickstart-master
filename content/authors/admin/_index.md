I'm currently studying computer vision at Peking University. Through my research, I hope to restore the image in the real scene. This makes me interested in blind restoration, generative modeling, and neural network designing  inspired by the optimization algorithm.

I have studied multi-view geometry, and I used it in my recent research work. Because I am particularly interested in the process of discovering phenomena, then looking for mathematical descriptions, and finally changing phenomena. So I try to achieve process control by visualizing neural networks and designing optimization algorithm step by step.
